# Uber Ridesharing Demand Analysis

## Project Overview
Ridesharing is a dynamic industry where demand fluctuates due to various factors like time, location, weather, and local events. Understanding these patterns is critical to optimizing operations and maximizing profitability. This project aims to analyze Uber ridesharing data in New York City to extract actionable insights that can help Uber improve its services and meet fluctuating demand efficiently.

## Objective
As a newly hired Data Scientist in Uber's New York Office, the objective is to analyze historical data and identify key factors that influence Uber pickups. The insights derived will help Uber make informed business decisions to enhance operational efficiency and increase market share.

## Key Questions
1. What are the different variables that influence the number of pickups?
2. Which factor affects the number of pickups the most? What could be the possible reasons for that?
3. What recommendations can be made to Uber management to capitalize on fluctuating demand?

## Data Description
The dataset contains Uber ride details across various boroughs of New York City, recorded hourly along with weather conditions. The key attributes include:

- **pickup_dt**: Date and time of the pickup
- **borough**: Borough in NYC where the pickup occurred
- **pickups**: Number of Uber pickups for the given hour
- **spd**: Wind speed (miles/hour)
- **vsb**: Visibility (miles to the nearest tenth)
- **temp**: Temperature (Fahrenheit)
- **dewp**: Dew point (Fahrenheit)
- **slp**: Sea level pressure
- **pcp01**: 1-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **pcp06**: 6-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **pcp24**: 24-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **sd**: Snow depth (inches)
- **hday**: Whether it was a holiday (Y/N)

## Insights
After analyzing the data, we observed the following trends:

1. **Manhattan is the most popular borough for Uber pickups.**
2. **Weather conditions do not significantly impact Uber demand.** Contrary to intuition, factors like wind speed, precipitation, and temperature have minimal influence on the number of pickups.
3. **Uber demand has steadily increased from January to June 2015.**
4. **Weekend pickups are higher compared to weekdays.**
5. **Peak demand occurs during office commute hours and late evenings.**
   - Demand rises between **6 AM and 10 AM** and peaks again between **7 PM and midnight**.
   - High demand on **Saturday nights** indicates Uber is a preferred transportation option for nightlife.
6. **Uber is commonly used for regular office commutes.**
7. **Mondays show lower demand, requiring further investigation.**

## Business Recommendations
Based on the insights, the following recommendations can help Uber optimize its operations:

1. **Expand operations in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.** While Manhattan dominates, other boroughs show growth potential.
2. **Ensure high cab availability during peak hours.**
   - **Weekday mornings (6 AM - 10 AM) and evenings (7 PM - midnight).**
   - **Saturday nights**, when demand peaks significantly.
3. **Maintain momentum in ride growth.** The steady increase in rides suggests strong user trust and adoption.
4. **Investigate the lower demand on Mondays.** Understanding user behavior can help Uber strategize better.
5. **Improve fleet management using predictive analytics.**
   - Collect and analyze **fleet size data** to optimize vehicle distribution.
   - Build a **machine learning model** to accurately predict hourly pickups and optimize cab availability accordingly.
6. **Implement dynamic pricing models.** Further data on pricing can help develop a model that determines the optimal fare for different time periods and locations.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data-driven insights, Uber can enhance its efficiency, improve user experience, and maximize revenue. This project provides a foundational analysis to guide Uber's strategic decision-making in optimizing ridesharing services in New York City.
